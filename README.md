# Flu Dashboard Project

## Description

This project involves creating a Tableau dashboard to visualize flu immunization data. The data was generated using Synthea and processed using SQL queries to produce a CSV file that was then used to create the Tableau dashboard.


## Data Sources

- `encounters.zip`: Contains encounter data.
- `conditions.txt`: Contains condition data.
- `immunizations.txt`: Contains immunization data.
- `patients.txt`: Contains patient data.
- `Flu Demo Data.csv`: The processed data used in the Tableau dashboard.

## SQL Queries

The SQL queries used to process the data can be found in the `sql/SQL_queries.sql` file.

## Tableau Dashboard

The Tableau dashboard file `Flu Shots Dashboard.twb` can be found in the `dashboard` directory. This dashboard provides visual insights into the flu immunization data.


## Technologies Used

- **Synthea**: For generating synthetic health data.
- **SQL**: For processing data.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization.
